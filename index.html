        <p>Finding a missing person can be a difficult task, but if you know where to look, it is often much easier to
            find a
            missing person.</p>
        <p>The directory of missing people uses Openchain to keep a track of each entry and make it transparent.</p>
        <p>For those who are not aware, Openchain is a Blockchain technology. but it directly links
            transactions to one another instead of having to use blocks. </p>
        <p>This makes our directory faster.</p>
        <p>Psst. Our directory is scalable too, that is, it is almost endless, and free. </p>
        <p>Fast, endless and free- isn't
            this every Indians' wet dream? *wink wink*</p>
